  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Network Engineer, Cloud Professional, and Developer with a deep passion for building and managing the 'nuts and bolts' of digital infrastructure. My experience is rooted in hands-on, practical application, primarily through designing, deploying, and maintaining my own homelab environments. I thrive on the challenge of making systems work, from the physical layer to the application stack, and I am actively seeking my next opportunity to contribute my skills.
